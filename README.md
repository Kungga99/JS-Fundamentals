# 0-javascript_is_amazing.js

This repository contains a simple JavaScript script that prints:

## Description

- The script creates a **constant variable** named `myVar` with the value `"JavaScript is amazing"`.
- It then uses `console.log(...)` to print the value of `myVar` to the console.
- **No `var` keyword** is used â€” only `const` as required.
